        <div class="story1">The Magic Wand by Sniper33</div>
        <div class="story11">Miranda had been visiting the local Dollar Store in Dayton, Ohio, for the past fifteen years or so, from a time when she had collected necessities for her father until she ended up being a parent herself. A lone one at that; her dad had ran off with some other lady and never called, not even for their young daughter, Debbie. Miranda felt that, maybe just a little bit, Debbie had changed in his absence. They had been close for a good few years before something in him snapped, and all he left was a note.

            "Dear Miranda + Debs.
            
            I am leaving. I have found someone else, and I will never come back. I love you both."
            
            If there could have been a better way to sugar-coat it, this was not it, but life goes on and Debbie was always the most important thing in Miranda's life anyway, it's not like she seemed too distressed, more indifferent. Until the age of twelve, Debbie had barely left the house except for school, but now was her time to try and go shopping on her own. Who knows, she might meet some new friends along the way.
            
            "Debbie, have you still got the list I gave you?"
            
            "Yeah, mom." Still dressed in her school outfit, Miranda's proud little daughter sauntered into the kitchen, looking for her things. Then she gave her that questionable look as if to say "Can I go now?". Miranda understood it and nodded. Debbie grabbed her backpack, list and with the cash in hand she left the house.
            
            Miranda watched her daughter from the window before returning to the kitchen. This silence was somewhat comforting, it made a change, maybe that's why she really wanted Debbie to go to the Dollar Store instead, just to get some peace and quiet. I'll just sit here and wait, she decided to herself, Debbie won't be long, will she?
            
            Debbie had found pretty much everything on the list with ease and good pace, having gotten used to knowing where everything was thanks to frequent trips to the store with her mom. She also felt older doing this, and more independent. Luckily all of the goods were light and easy to carry even in three bags, and getting home wasn't a great trek. Although, it was certainly going to be different this time.
            
            An old lady stopped the girl in her tracks.
            
            "Excuse me, dear, would you like anything?"
            
            Margaret, Marge, something like that... someone she had seen before selling cheap toys and games at her stall, which she had moved away from to confront Debbie.
            
            "I don't have money left, ma'am, sorry, I was just shopping for my mom."</div>
        <div class="story2">Slenderman's Return by Tiberiu</div>
        <div class="story22">After waking up with a jolt, the girl laid in bed a few seconds longer. Reaching over to switch on her bedside lamp, she tried to remember exactly what had stolen her sweet slumber away. When she couldn’t, the brunette swung her legs over the side of the bed and heaved herself up. Checking the time on her phone, she snorted when she saw it was midnight- the witching hour. Knowing that sleep would only evade her, she left her bedroom for the kitchen, a good cup of coffee on her mind. As she passed by her front door, a chill spread like liquid fire down her spine. It’s only winter, she told herself, focusing again on the coffee plan. Measuring out scoops, water, and preparing her cup kept her occupied, but as the dark liquid boiled, she had nothing left to keep her mind from wandering off. The chill returned and she couldn’t help but glance behind her to the front door. It stood there innocently enough, just like always. The dead bolt was still in place and she could see nothing amiss with it. Turning back to her coffee, she did her best to forget about the feeling. With her cup in hand, she started back towards her bedroom. As she walked by the front door, she decided that a quick glance out of the peep hole would help calm her restless mind. The chill worsened with each step she took towards the door and further away from the safety and warmth of her blankets. She pressed her empty hand against the cold, metal door and took a deep breath before leading her eye to the peep hole. At first, she could only see an inky blackness and somehow seemed to swirl in itself. When she blinked in surprise, the void melted away. She wished it hadn’t. In it’s place, there stood what she could only guess was once a man. The limbs were long and inhumanly awkward, with bulky joints branching off into several arms, not unlike the branches of a tree. The creature was draped in a black suit, somehow making the thing more nightmarish to her. The icing on the proverbial cake, however, was what passed as the hellish thing’s face. It was as though her mind blurred the ghastly visage to spare itself further shock and horror. She shoved herself away from the door with the hand still pressed against it. The scalding mug of coffee fell, the liquid burning her bare legs as she fell backwards and tried to crawl away from the door. She knew, somehow, that her mind hadn’t been playing tricks on her. As she crab walked away from the door, she watched as tendrils as black as the void she first saw snake around through the cracks. The girl was trapped between the instinct to flee and the gut feeling to not turn her back on the door. When the door jolted, the urge to flee overcame her and she slipped in the burning liquid as she tried to make it back to her room. She knew deep down that she was trapping herself in a corner, but she had to get away from the door. The girl was halfway down the hallway when she heard the previously locked door creak open. She screamed and slipped into a wall, cracking her chin on it and stunning her. After that, there was only blackness. * * * * * “Nicole?” a warm, male voice snapped the woman out of her trance. As she turned around, she was met by one of her sister’s doctor’s. She nodded, not sure if she should say anything, or even if she could find her voice if she did have something to say. That morning, she had gotten an urgent phone call from the hospital, saying that her sister, Lindsay, was there. Before they had even let her see her, the doctor’s had pulled her off to the side and insisted that they talk to her about what might have happened. Phrases like ‘self-inflected’ and ‘assault’ had been thrown around and Nicole felt her mind reel. She still hadn’t fully understood what they had been saying until she saw Lindsay with her own eyes. Her little sister had a bandage wrapped around her head, covering both of her ears as well as her eyes. They said it was to keep her now deadened eyes from drying out and to try to keep infection out of the wounds Lindsay had made to her ears. The doctors had guessed that either she or someone else had jammed a pencil into them to keep her off balance or to deafen herself against something. There was the mix of first and second degree burns on her hands, legs, and feet, from what was assumed to be the coffee her neighbors found slipped all over the entry to her apartment. As Nicole walked into her sister’s hospital room the first time, she thought she had spied the silhouette of a man in the window. That, she knew, was impossible. Her sister’s room was on the third story of the hospital.</div>
        <div class="story3">Run...NOW by Opy23</div>
        <div class="story33">The rainy season began in early summer, and June had been no exception. It did not surprise the man when he discovered rainwater dripping from his dining room ceiling. Shrugging it off, he placed a tall pot beneath the leak and expected it to stop on its own. However, it continued to rain, and before he knew it, the pot would threaten to overflow. He had to dump the water out first thing in the morning and straight after he returned home from work.

            Eventually, he began to notice water damage at the source of the leak. The white ceiling had discolored, turning a dull shade of brown. He checked the weather and realized that it would continue to rain sporadically over the next 10 days. The man was worried about the ceiling mildewing and becoming an expensive repair, so he called a local handyman.
            
            Unfortunately, the man could not sign to have the repairs done–only his landlord could. It was a frustrating policy. The man called his landlord but could not reach him. He left him a few voicemails, detailing how the damage was becoming progressively worse. The man was clueless as to why his landlord would not return his calls; they usually kept in touch, speaking at least twice a month. Finally, he reasoned that he would not be held accountable for any damages sustained.
            
            One night, the man was startled awake by a massive thump. He quickly turned on his bedside lamp, and just vaguely, he could see an overturned table and a large shape laying across it. He sprinted out of his apartment and called the police, gagging at the smell.
            
            The man sat in the police station with a blanket wrapped around his shoulders and a coffee mug resting in his hands. He did know one thing. There had been a dead body in his ceiling, and the water had saturated it so badly that it caved under the weight. So far, the body was unidentifiable due to the rainwater and was being autopsied. While the man waited, he called his landlord and finally reached him, panicking as he explained the situation. His landlord was just as alarmed, and the man pleaded for him to come to the station while he made his statement. The man paused as a detective crossed over to him, and he lowered his phone, wondering if the body had been identified. His blood ran immediately cold, and he shook his head with terror. The body belonged to Richard Thompson, his landlord, and he had died over a year ago. That’s not what disturbed him the most. If his landlord was dead, then who was pretending to be him?</div>
        <div class="story4">The Demon Adela is coming by Andrei Tava</div>
        <div class="story44">I’m not going to lie to you, nor will I attempt to justify my heinous actions. I am a mass murderer, a serial killer of the worst kind. Over a twenty year period I’ve been directly or indirectly responsible for upwards of three hundred murders. I don’t kill for a cause or because I get some kind of perverse pleasure from it. Instead, I murder people for money, power and status. I’ll let you decide whether that’s better or worse.

            The majority of my victims are officially recorded as ‘missing, presumed dead’. Their bodies have never been found, nor will they be. That’s close to three hundred families who will never know for sure what happened to their people. I’m certainly not proud of what I’ve done, or for the carnage and misery I’ve inflicted.
